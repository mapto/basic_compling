# Basic computational linguistics

Examples of basic use of spaCy and HuggingFace Transformers.

These were prepared for the purpose of the following presentations:
* [Hands-on NLP across dozens of languages with spaCy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NZkMUlTNUDwCzmflM3PiVJYyjngEnb5m0_8JtX4-NBk)
* [Transformers API](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zu_zcarwOjUb0GEOu0Jt3jtoC-yJj9VHNtttu-lfT0I)


# Getting Started

To get started with Python, follow [this guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

Beyond the ["Automate the boring stuff with Python" book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), there are a number of useful tools online, e.g. these [interactive tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/).

The .ipynb files are made to be opened with Jupyter [notebook](https://jupyter.org/install). It is an important learning tool and so is the [interactive console](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/index.html), where you could experiment with your own code.

You would need to install either [spaCy and its language pipelines](https://spacy.io/usage), or [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation), depending on the tasks you would like to work on.
